      <p>A baby Darkwing Daphne is born. My first adventure outside is quite exhilirating. There are lots of smiling faces. One of the humans smells like freshly baked cookies. I can't wait to try a cookie.</p>

      <p>It's been a long time since I wrote in the adventure log. I apologize, but youth has been so full of adventuring and excitement that I haven't had a chance to write. I'm doing well. I learned how to rollerblade this summer! My parents had some specially made for my duck feet.</p>

      <p>Today is the most important day of my life because I discovered the joy of cats. I now spend at least half my day looking at books about cats and drawing cats.</p>

      <p>Today is ACTUALLY the most important day of my life. We got America Online dial-up and I discovered the internet is for cats. I now spend all my time browsing the internet looking at cute cat pictures.</p>

      <p>I'm sorry that I have been away for so long. I've been busy since the last log. It took -many- years, but I have now seen every cute cat picture on the internet. Wait, someone just posted another. Okay, I have NOW seen every cute cat picture on the internet. AAAHHHHH. Someone just posted three more. I've been at this for years now, and it just never stops. Help!</p>
